# Parking-Allotment-System
The proposed parking allotment system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. 
The system consists of two main components: 

The user interface and the database. The user interface is designed to be intuitive
and easy to use, allowing residents to quickly reserve parking spots and
management to monitor the parking situation in real-time. 

The database stores all relevant information about the parking allotment system,
including resident information, parking spot availability, and usage history.

It also sends a reminder message when time is about to end
